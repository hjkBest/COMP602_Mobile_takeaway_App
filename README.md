Introduction
=====
> Our team project purpose is to build a modern, useful application that could help our user to order their takeaway easier than before. Our team project is trying to provide a platform that includes many restaurants. So, the user could have more option when they want to order a takeaway. We will manage user order information and generate a unique order ID used to avoid mess up the order. We put the send button down below each menu page; the request will send to the restaurants when the user clicks the button. And a QR code will produce and get to the user.
